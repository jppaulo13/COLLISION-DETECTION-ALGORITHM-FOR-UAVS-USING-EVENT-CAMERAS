# COLLISION-DETECTION-ALGORITHM-FOR-UAVS-USING-EVENT-CAMERAS

This repository contains an implementation of a collision detection algorithm for UAVs using event cameras. The algorithm takes as input the stream of events from the camera and outputs the locations of the dynamic objeccts within the scene.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Numpy
PyTorch
Event Camera Simulator (optional)

Getting Started
To get started, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/<username>/collision-detection-uavs-event-cameras.git


Next, install the required packages using the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the Algorithm
To run the algorithm, simply run the collision_detection.py file as follows:
python collision_detection.py
